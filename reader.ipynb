criteria.', 'He says that in another VRscenario you can see rain that’s not there in reality, and that an engine in thescenario is not a real engine.', 'In Deutsch’s view, VR environments are realbut the objects in them are illusions.', 'Simulation realism makes a muchstronger claim than this.', 'Of course, if we’re in a perfect simulation, then some things aren’texactly as they seem.', 'Some of what we believe will be wrong.', 'Most peoplebelieve that they’re not in a simulation.', 'They believe that flowers are notdigital.', 'They may believe that their universe is the ultimate reality.', 'If we’rein a simulation, those beliefs will be wrong.', 'But the undermined beliefshere are mostly scientific or philosophical beliefs about reality.', 'Undermining them does not undermine everyday beliefs such as There areflowers blooming in the garden.', 'If we’re in an imperfect simulation, more of our beliefs will be wrong,but plenty will still be right.', 'If the solar system is fully simulated but therest of the universe is only a sketch, then my beliefs about the Sun may becorrect, but my beliefs about Alpha Centauri may be wrong.', 'If 2019 issimulated but 1789 was not, then my beliefs about the French Revolutionmay be false, but my beliefs about the contemporary United States may becorrect.', 'Still, we’ll be right about those closer-to-home aspects of theuniverse that are present in the simulation.', 'Assuming the deer I see in mygarden is part of the simulation, I’ll still be right that there’s a deer in mygarden.', 'The simulation hypothesis as metaphysicsI’m sure that some of these claims sound counterintuitive to you.', 'Onesource of resistance is that trees and flowers certainly don’t seem to bedigital objects.', 'But they don’t seem to be quantum mechanical objectseither.', 'Yet deep down they are, and few people think that the mere fact thattrees are grounded in quantum processes makes them less real.', 'I think thatbeing digital is just like being quantum mechanical here.', 'Science has taught us that there’s much more to reality than initiallyseems to be the case.', 'For millennia, we didn’t know that cats and dogs andtrees are made of cells, let alone that the cells are made of atoms or thatthose are fundamentally quantum mechanical.', 'Yet these discoveries aboutthe nature of cats and dogs and trees have not undermined their reality.', 'If I’m right, the discovery that we’re in a simulation should be treatedthe same way.', 'It will be a discovery about the underlying nature of cats anddogs and trees—that they spring from digital processes—but it won’tundermine their reality.', 'Importantly, I’m not saying in an unqualified way that a simulated treeis the same as a real tree.', 'I’ve said that if we’re in a perfect permanentsimulation, then the real trees of our universe are simulated trees—that is,real trees have been digital trees all along.', 'On the other hand, if we’re not insuch a simulation and are merely looking at one from the outside, then thetrees in the simulation are completely different from the trees in our outsideworld: Simulated trees are digital; real trees are not.', 'The real trees of ourworld have been nondigital entities all along.', 'Either way, digital entities andnondigital entities are quite different things.', 'I will argue that the simulation hypothesis should be seen as a variant ofthe “it-from-bit” hypothesis that’s been widely discussed in physics.', 'Thishypothesis posits a digital level underlying physics: roughly speaking,molecules are made of atoms, atoms are made of quarks, and quarks aremade of bits.', 'This is a view in which physical processes are real.', 'There arejust underlying levels to reality that we don’t know about yet.', 'I think that’s the correct way to think about the simulation hypothesis.', 'Ifthe simulation hypothesis is true, the it-from-bit hypothesis is true.', 'Physicalreality is perfectly real—there’s just an underlying level consisting of theinteraction of bits, and perhaps still further levels still underlying that.', 'The it-from-bit hypothesis corresponds to one part of the simulationhypothesis—the simulation itself.', 'What about the other part—the simulatorwho initiated the simulation?', 'In the next chapter, I’ll argue that thesimulator is analogous to a god.', 'At least, the simulator can be seen as thecreator of the it-from-bit universe.', 'In chapter 9, I’ll argue that thesimulation hypothesis is itself a combination of the it-from-bit hypothesisand the creation hypothesis (according to which a creator created theuniverse).', 'If I’m right, the simulation hypothesis is not a skeptical hypothesis inwhich nothing exists.', 'Instead it is a metaphysical hypothesis, a hypothesisabout the nature of reality.', 'It’s equivalent to a metaphysical hypothesis (thecreation hypothesis) about how our world was created, plus a separatemetaphysical hypothesis (the it-from-bit hypothesis) about what underliesreality in our world.', 'If the simulation hypothesis is right, the physical worldis made of bits, and a creator created the physical world by arranging thosebits.', 'In the next three chapters, I’ll lay out the creation hypothesis and the it-from-bit-hypothesis and then argue that the simulation hypothesis isroughly equivalent to the two hypotheses put together.', 'Along the way, I’lldiscuss many connected issues about God and about reality.', 'The no-illusion view in the history of philosophyMy response to Cartesian skepticism rests on a positive answer to theReality Question.', 'In a perfect simulation, things are perfectly real.', 'Thesame goes for other Cartesian scenarios, such as Descartes’s evil-demonscenario and Hilary Putnam’s brain-in-a-vat scenario.', 'Generalizingsimulation realism to these scenarios, we arrive at the no-illusion view ofCartesian scenarios.', 'In these scenarios, things are largely as they seem.', 'Subjects in these situations aren’t deceived; they have largely true beliefsabout the world.', 'If the no-illusion view is right, then Cartesian scenarios are no bar toknowing about the external world.', 'If most of our beliefs are correct in aCartesian scenario, then our inability to rule out that scenario does nothingto cast doubt on our beliefs.', 'Our beliefs are more robust than manyCartesians have thought.', 'I’m not the first to advocate a response to skepticism holding thatsubjects in these scenarios have largely true beliefs.', 'Still, it’s striking howuncommon this view has been in the history of philosophy.', 'Recently, Iasked a number of historians of philosophy whether they knew of anyoneexplicitly endorsing this view before the 20th century.', 'No one could comeup with a clear case.', 'Even in the 20th century, there were only a handful ofbrief discussions of it.', 'I suspected that George Berkeley, the 18th-century Anglo-Irishphilosopher we first encountered in chapter 4, might have held this view.', 'Recall that Berkeley was an idealist who argued that appearance is reality.', 'In an evil-demon scenario, the tables and chairs have the same appearanceas tables and chairs in the physical world.', 'If appearance is reality, it followsthat people in that scenario will experience real tables and chairs, and willhave mostly true beliefs about their reality.', 'Alas, it looks as if Berkeley never endorsed this view.', 'He neverdiscusses Descartes’s evil-demon scenario at all.', 'He would probably haveconsidered the evil demon an impossibility; like Descartes, he thought Godalone was perfect enough to produce sensations and perceptions like ours.', 'Still, he insisted that God is doing this and when he’s doing it, we’re gettingthings right.', 'You could think of that as a cousin of my view on skepticalscenarios, with God playing the role of the simulator or evil demon.', 'The first really clear statement of the no-illusion view that I know ofappears in a 1949 essay by the University of Nebraska philosopher OetsKolk Bouwsma.', 'Bouwsma was a student of Ludwig Wittgenstein, whoinspired Jonathan Harrison’s hallucinating Baby Ludwig in chapter 4.', 'Bouwsma’s article “Descartes’ Evil Genius” is a wonderful fable about ahapless evil demon who sets out to deceive us about reality and alwaysfails.', '(Bouwsma translates “malignus genium” as “evil genius,” but I’ll usethe more common “evil demon,” as in chapter 3.)', 'The demon first turnseverything into paper, but people quickly notice.', 'Tom, the humanprotagonist of the story, who has himself been turned into paper, detects theillusion.', 'He finds that paper flowers don’t smell or feel the same, and theevil demon is exposed.', 'Figure 17 Bouwsma’s evil demon tries to deceive Tom, first with paper flowers and then withperfect simulations.', 'In his second attempt, the evil demon destroys everything exceptpeople’s minds.', 'He grows cocky and whispers to Tom, “Your flowers arenothing but illusions.”', 'Tom replies that he can tell the difference betweenflowers and illusions, and these are plainly not illusions.', 'He understandswhat the evil demon has done, but he says that what the demon calls anillusion, he calls a flower.', 'The demon has not created an illusion, he hascreated flowers.', 'The demon rides off on a corpuscle, defeated.', 'Like me, Bouwsma thinks that the subject in Descartes’s evil-demonscenario is not undergoing an illusion.', 'His reasons differ from mine,however.', 'Bouwsma thinks that an illusion is an illusion only if it can bediscovered.', 'If an illusion cannot be discovered, as in Descartes’s evil-demon scenario, it’s not an illusion at all, and it’s not a deception.', 'More precisely, Bouwsma’s evil demon can discover the illusion, buthis subject, Tom, cannot.', 'So when the demon says, “This is an illusion,”he’s correct, but if Tom were to say this, Tom would be wrong.', 'For similarreasons, what Tom experiences counts as a “flower” for Tom but not for thedemon.', 'Consequently, when Tom says, “That’s a flower,” he’s correct.', 'Bouwsma’s reasoning here is grounded in a sort of verificationism,which says that all meaningful claims are verifiable.', 'You’ll recall thatearlier we discussed the verificationism of Rudolf Carnap and other logicalpositivists, who held that skeptical hypotheses are unverifiable andtherefore meaningless.', 'Bouwsma takes a related line.', 'He thinks that thehypothesis that there’s an illusion is meaningless if it cannot be verified.', 'Ifwe can never verify that the evil-demon scenario is an illusion, it’s not anillusion at all.', 'For reasons I discussed in chapter 4, I reject verificationism.', 'Manymeaningful claims are unverifiable, and there may well be illusions wenever discover.', 'So I reject Bouwsma’s analysis of the situation.', 'Nevertheless, I think he’s right about the crucial point.', 'The subject inDescartes’s evil-demon scenario is not undergoing an illusion.', 'A related route to the no-illusion view that shares some of the spirit ofBerkeley’s idealism is suggested by the Chinese philosopher Philip Zhai(who now publishes as Zhenming Zhai) in his important 1998 book GetReal: A Philosophical Adventure in Virtual Reality.', 'Zhai holds that as longas we have stable and coherent perception of an object, that object is real.', 'Inthe spirit of Berkeley, we might say that stable and coherent appearance isreality.', 'Zhai does not apply this thesis to issues about skepticism, but heapplies it to virtual reality and perfect simulations.', 'A subject in a perfectsimulation will have stable and coherent perception of the world, so byZhai’s lights the world is real and not an illusion.', 'I reject Zhai’s idealistframework for much the same reasons that I rejected Berkeley’s idealism inchapter 4, but like verificationism, idealism provides one important route tothe no-illusion view.', 'A third route to the no-illusion view is suggested by Hilary Putnam inhis 1981 book Reason, Truth and History.', 'In chapter 4, we encounteredPutnam’s argument that the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis is contradictory basedon externalism, his theory that the meaning of a word depends on itsexternal context.', 'Putnam suggests that the beliefs of a brain in a vat areabout the electronic impulses in its environment, and that these beliefs aremostly true.', 'This is a version of the no-illusion view that can potentiallydrive an entirely different response to skepticism (though Putnam doesn’tmake the connection to skepticism).', 'Instead of arguing that the brain-in-a-vat hypothesis is contradictory, one could argue that the beliefs of a brain ina vat are mostly true.', 'In effect, where Bouwsma argues fromverificationism to the no-illusion view, Putnam argues from externalism tothe no-illusion view.', 'I’ll analyze Putnam’s argument for the no-illusion view in chapter 20,where I discuss externalism.', 'In my view, the argument doesn’t quitesucceed.', 'Just as Bouwsma’s argument requires an implausibleverificationism and Zhai’s view requires an implausible idealism, Putnam’sargument requires a strong and implausible version of externalism.', 'Still,like Bouwsma and Zhai, Putnam is on the right track in holding the no-illusion view.', 'Bouwsma, Putnam, and Zhai offer three different routes to the no-illusion view of simulation scenarios.', 'All three routes can lead to what Ithink is the correct view of the Cartesian skeptical problem: the subject inCartesian scenarios has largely true beliefs and is not deceived.', 'However,all three routes rest on strong and implausible philosophical views that Ireject.', 'As a result, I think that none of these three philosophers has given astrong argument for the no-illusion view nor a plausible analysis of just whyit is true.', 'So we’re still in search of a good argument and a plausibleanalysis.', 'I think the best argument for the no-illusion view comes not fromverificationism, idealism, or externalism but from a sort of structuralismabout the external world.', 'I’ll work up to this argument gradually in the nextthree chapters.', 'Chapter 7Is God a hacker in the nextuniverse up?', 'A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO, MY THEN-FIVE-YEAR-OLD NEPHEW Tom showedme how to play SimLife.', 'He painstakingly built up a city with houses andcars, surrounded by trees.', 'Then he told me “Here comes the fun part.”', 'Hecalled up fires and tidal waves to destroy the city.', 'I saw my nephew in anew light.', 'Was he just a five-year-old kid playing games?', 'Or was he an OldTestament God?', 'In an episode of Rick and Morty, the eccentric scientist Rick keeps amicroscopic world of bicyclists under the hood of his spaceship in order togenerate power.', 'Every now and
